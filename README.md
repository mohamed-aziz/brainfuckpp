# Brainfuck++

Brainfuck++ is inspired by (http://www.codeabbey.com/index/wiki/brainfuck)[codeabbey's brainfuck++ description], it's basically brainfuck with some "improvements", it's written in ol'good Pascal.

## Install it!

So you basically need to simply clone this repo and compile BRAINFUCK.pas using any pascal compiler you have (though I only tested this on my freepascal 3.0.0)

* Clone it?

> git clone brainfuckpp

* Compile it? (or use the pre compiled binary under linux 4.6.0 and glibc 2.23 with fpc 3.0.0)

> fpc -gl BRAINFUCK.pas

## Usage

> ./BRAINFUCK filename
